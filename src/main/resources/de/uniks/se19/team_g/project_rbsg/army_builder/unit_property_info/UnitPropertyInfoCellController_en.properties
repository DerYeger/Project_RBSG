health=Health is measured in health points (shortened to HP) which lowers by a from the server calculated amount when the unit is attacked. If the HP of a unit reaches zero that unit is barred from taking further action and is taken from the battlefield.
movement=Movement Points (shortened to MP) are the resource used when moving a unit during the movement phases. For each time you traverse a field, you spend one MP. When your movement points reach zero that unit can't go any further. When they're not zero and the unit is moved this unit stays furthermore selected and can be moved again.
canAttack=Attack Strength indicates the physical power against other units. Each unit has different strengthpoints which are used to attack another units. It's also possible that units can not be attacked at all. The "Can attack" box shows this with the percentage strength to every other unit.
